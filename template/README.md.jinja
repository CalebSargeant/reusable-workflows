2. Delete any workflow files that are marked as "NOT CONFIGURED" if you don't need them
3. Read `WORKFLOWS-README.md` for detailed setup instructions
4. Configure required secrets in your repository settings
5. Test the workflows by triggering them manually or via commits

## Updating

To update these workflows in the future, run:

```bash
copier update
```

This will pull the latest changes from the template while preserving your configuration.
